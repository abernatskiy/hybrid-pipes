# Hybrid Pipes SDK distro and examples

Hybrid Pipes SDK is Subsquid's newest approach to indexing. This repo contains its code extracted from one of our internal repos:
 - [/core](/core) folder / `@abernatskiy/hybrid-pipes-core` package contains basic primitives for building data pipelines;
 - [/streams](/streams) folder / `@abernatskiy/hybrid-pipes-streams` package contains some ready-made data sources;
 - [/examples](/examples) folder contains examples of usage of both.

> [!NOTE]
> The main developer of this is @mo4islona, with heavy inspiration from @belopash's work.
